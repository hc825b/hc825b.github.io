# My Info

+ [NSF CPS: Software Defined Control for Smart Manufacturing Systems][grant]

  - Project is on formal model for controller networks in Manufacturing Systems
  - I focus on security aspect of the system
  - In particular, communication security analysis. In short, can we guarantee
    messages are kept secret even when adversaries are sniffing and spoofing?
