# Questions and Goals

+ Digital Manufacturing and Design Innovation Institute (DMDII)
+ Critical Infrastructure Resilience Institute (CIRI)

  - What are some ongoing works from these institutes?

+ [NIST Cybersecurity Framework and Manufacturing Profile][profile]

  - What are the guidelines for manufacturers?
  - What is the road map for researchers?
  - What are some existing software or hardware infrastructures available for
    both manufacturers and researchers?

    + Software simulated test-beds, Digital Twins
    + Koushik mentioned in an [article] that a test-bed for penetration
      testing is ongoing in DMDII
    + NIST also has a [test-bed] but more for system design

[test-bed]:https://www.nist.gov/laboratories/tools-instruments/smart-manufacturing-systems-sms-test-bed

+ Identify people who are closer to or interested in our broad research area

  - With sufficient technical background and experiences in industry
  
    + Director of Manufacturing Cybersecurity, Koushik Subramanian
  
  - Potential speakers for future events
  - Further collaboration with industry or government
  


# My Info

+ [NSF CPS: Software Defined Control for Smart Manufacturing Systems][grant]

  - Project is on formal model for controller networks in Manufacturing Systems
  - I focus on security aspect of the system
  - In particular, communication security analysis. In short, can we guarantee
    messages are kept secret even when adversaries are sniffing and spoofing?
