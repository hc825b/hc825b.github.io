I am a PhD candidate in the [Department of Computer Science in University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](CS @ Illinois).
My main research area is within
[Programming Languages, Formal Methods, and Software Engineering][PL/FM/SE].
Currently, I am doing research with my advisor, [Prof. Sayan Mitra][mitras] in [Reliable Autonomy Group][mitras-group],
and work as a graduate research assistant at [Information Trust Institute][ITI].

My broad research direction is to obtain the *provable safety assurance* on cyber-physical systems (CPS) in addition to field testing and software simulation.
Especially, my focus is on applying *formal methods* to verify CPS containing complex or underspecified components including distributed communication, incomplete vehicle dynamic model, vision based perception, and learning enabled controllers.

[Research Projects](/_pages/projects.md) describes our research projects with related publications.  
[About 橋](/_pages/about.md) contains more informal descriptions of myself.
