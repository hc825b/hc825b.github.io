I am a program-specific assistant professor at [Graduate School of Informatics][i.kyoto-u] in Kyoto University.
My main research area is within
Programming Languages, Formal Methods, and Software Engineering ([PL/FM/SE]).
Currently, I am doing research in [Computer Software Group][fos.kuis.kyoto-u]
and specifically working with Prof. Suenaga and Prof. Waga under the [CyPhAI] project.

My broad research direction is to obtain the *provable safety assurance* on cyber-physical systems (CPS) in addition to field-testing and software simulation.
Especially, my focus is on applying *formal methods* to verify CPS containing complex or underspecified components including distributed communication, incomplete vehicle dynamic model, vision based perception, and learning enabled controllers.


## Ongoing Projects

+ [Formal Analysis and Design of AI-intensive Cyber-Physical Systems][JSTCrest]  
  Hired as a postdoc under JST CREST
+ [Safety Verification of Black Box Cyber-Physical Systems via Lyapunov Stability Certificates][JSPSStartUp]  
  Funded by JSPS Research Activity Start-Up
