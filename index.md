I am a PhD candidate in [CS @ Illinois] and research in
[Programming Languages, Formal Methods, and Software Engineering][PL/FM/SE] area.
Currently, I am doing research with my advisor, [Prof. Sayan Mitra][mitras] in [Reliable Autonomy Group][mitras-group],
and work as a graduate research assistant at [Information Trust Institute][ITI].

My broad research direction is to obtain the *provable safety assurance* on cyber-physical systems (CPS) beyond field testing and software simulation.
Especially, my focus is on applying *formal methods* to verify CPS containing complex or underspecified components including distributed communication, incomplete vehicle dynamic model, vision based perception, and learning enabled controllers.
