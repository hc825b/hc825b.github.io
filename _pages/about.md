I am a PhD candidate in [CS @ Illinois] and research with my advisor, [Prof. Sayan Mitra][mitras], in
[Programming Languages, Formal Methods, and Software Engineering][PL/FM/SE] area.

Before joining CS @ Illinois, I worked under Prof. Yu-fang Chen and Prof. Bao-yaw Wang as a research assistant in [Institute of Information Science](iis) in Academia Sinica.
At the same time, I obtained my master's degree with Prof. Farn Wang at [Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering](ntugiee) in Nation Taiwan University.

I finished my undergrad at [Department of Electrical Engineering](ntuee) in NTU. For my entire senior year, I had the chance to learn about hardware verification with Dr. Jason Chou and [Prof. Ric Huang](ric). I was then exposed to formal methods for the first time and saw their applications in Electronic Design Automation.

I was born in Taiwan and learned to code in my junior high school.
My first programming languages are Visual Basic and C/C++.
I remember my first ever programming project is to find solutions to the 5x5 [LightsOut](lightsout) puzzle.

## Fun facts about my name

The two Chinese characters in my name are simple and common words, and kids in Chinese speaking countries will recognize them even before entering elementary schools.
The two characters however may be written, pronounced, and interpreted differently under different languages, regions, and contexts.
As a computer science researcher that also has to learn about electrical engineering and mechanical engineering,
I found these facts interesting as it mentally matches to the root causes of bugs in programming like ambiguous language semantics, nondeterministic behaviors depending on context/environment, and most frustrating of all, different conventions in different communities.

### Syntax
#### How my name may be written

正體中文(Traditional Chinese): 謝橋  
English: Hsieh, Chiao  
简体中文(Simplified Chinese): 谢桥  
日本漢字(Japanese Kanji): 謝橋  

#### How my name may be pronounced or spelled

注音(Zhuyin): ㄒㄧㄝˋ ㄑㄧㄠˊ  
拼音(Pinyin): Xiè Qiáo  
音読み(On'yomi): シャ/sha キョウ/kyou  

I was told several times that my given name 橋 sounds almost identical to a common Italian word *Ciao* which can serve as both hello and goodbye.

### Semantics
#### How characters in my name may be interpreted in different contexts

Chinese to English by Google translate
+ **謝**: 謝謝 -> thank, 感謝 -> appreciate, 凋謝 -> wither, 謝罪 -> apologize, 謝絕 -> decline, 新陳代謝 -> metabolism
+ **橋**: 橋 -> bridge, 橋接器 -> bridge (as the networking device in Computer Network)

Japanese to English by Google translate
+ **謝**: 謝る(あやまる) -> apologize, 感謝(かんしゃ) -> appreciate, 謝絕(しゃぜつ) -> decline, 新陳代謝(しんちんたいしゃ) -> metabolism
+ **橋**: 橋(はし) -> bridge


### Appearance in Ancient Chinese Poems

小令尊前見玉簫。銀燈一曲太妖嬈。歌中醉倒誰能恨，唱罷歸來酒未消。
春悄悄，夜迢迢。碧雲天共楚宮遙。夢魂慣得無拘檢，又踏楊花過謝橋。
—— 晏幾道《鷓鴣天》

誰翻樂府淒涼曲？風也蕭蕭，雨也蕭蕭，瘦盡燈花又一宵。不知何事縈懷抱，醒也無聊，醉也無聊，夢也何曾到謝橋。
—— 納蘭性德《採桑子》

Both poems uses 謝橋 as a metonym of the "bridge" connecting to where the authors meet their ideal female or the performer they adore and admire, much like the Japanese idol in my interpretation.
It originates from a talented 妓 (female performer trained in music and dancing, though its modern meaning has changed) with the surname 謝.
謝家 (Xie's house) is then used to refer to the high end place to enjoy her performance (similar to a Geisha House),
and 謝橋 means the path to the place and, in my interpretation, symbolizes the connection to the great enjoyment from meeting their idol.


### Places with the same name

There are plenty of 谢桥 (Xie bridge) and 谢桥村 (Xieqiao village) in Mainland China to my surprise.
