I am a PhD candidate in [CS @ Illinois] and research with my advisor, [Prof. Sayan Mitra][mitras], in
[Programming Languages, Formal Methods, and Software Engineering][PL/FM/SE] area.

Before joining CS @ Illinois, I worked under Prof. Yu-fang Chen and Prof. Bao-yaw Wang as a research assistant in [Institute of Information Science](iis) in Academia Sinica.
At the same time, I obtained my master's degree with Prof. Farn Wang at [Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering](ntugiee) in Nation Taiwan University.

I finished my undergrad at [Department of Electrical Engineering](ntuee) in NTU. For my entire senior year, I had the chance to learn about hardware verification with Dr. Jason Chou and [Prof. Ric Huang](ric). I was then exposed to formal methods for the first time and saw their applications in Electronic Design Automation.

I was born in Taiwan and learned to code in my junior high school.
My first programming languages are Visual Basic and C/C++.
I remember my first ever programming project is to find solutions to the 5x5 [LightsOut](lightsout) puzzle.

### Fun facts about my name

The two Chinese characters in my name are simple and common words, and kids in Chinese speaking countries will recognize them even before entering elementary. The two characters however may be written, pronounced, and interpreted differently under different languages, regions, and contexts.
I found these facts interesting as
