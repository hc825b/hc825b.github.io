Before joining CS @ Illinois, I obtained my master's degree at [Graduate Institute of Electronics Engineering](ntugiee) in Nation Taiwan University. At the same, I worked under Prof. Yu-fang Chen and Prof. Bao-yaw Wang as a part-time research assistant in [Institute of Information Science](iis) in Academia Sinica.

I finished my undergrad at [Department of Electrical Engineering](ntuee) in NTU. For my entire senior year, I had the chance to learn about hardware verification with Dr. Jason Chou and [Prof. Ric Huang](ric). I was then first exposed to formal methods and their applications in Electronic Design Automation.

### Fun facts about my name

The two Chinese characters in my name are simple and common words, and kids in Chinese speaking countries will recognize them even before entering elementary. The two characters however may be written, pronounced, and interpreted differently under different languages, regions, and contexts.
I found these facts interesting as

#### How my name may be pronounced or spelled

注音(Zhuyin): ㄒㄧㄝˋ ㄑㄧㄠˊ  
拼音(Pinyin): Xiè Qiáo

I was told several times that my given name *Chiao* sounds almost identical to a common Italian word *Ciao* which can serve as both hello and goodbye.
