My broad research direction is the formal verification of the cyber-physical system~(CPS) containing complex components.
such as .

Due to the nature of as an interdisciplinary research area, the main intuition behind all *TODO: unfinished*
is to apply the abstraction refinement principle to decompose the verification problem of CPS into component level verification subproblems.

## CyPhyHouse: toolchain for distributed robotics

Project Webcite: https://cyphyhouse.github.io


I have been working on the CyPhyHouse toolchain since Summer 2018. aims to provide programming, debugging, and deployment benefits for distributed mobile robotic applications. Develop hardware-agnostic, distributed applications using the high-level, event driven Koord programming language included with CyPhyHouse, without requiring expertise in controller design or distributed network protocols.
