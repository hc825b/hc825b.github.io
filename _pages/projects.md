My broad research direction is the formal *assurance* of the cyber-physical system~(CPS) containing complex components that may be incompletely specified or currently intractable for existing formal verification techniques.
For such systems, the current best practice is to rely on extensive testing and simulation to search for design errors and falsify the system implementation.

In my PhD study, I look into several systems containing incomplete vehicle dynamics, vision-based perception pipelines, communication protocols, or combinations of above.
 The main intuition behind all *TODO: unfinished*
is to apply the abstraction refinement principle to decompose the verification problem of CPS into component level verification subproblems.

## CyPhyHouse: toolchain for distributed robotics

Project Webcite: https://cyphyhouse.github.io

I have been working on the CyPhyHouse toolchain since Summer 2018. aims to provide programming, debugging, and deployment benefits for distributed mobile robotic applications. Develop hardware-agnostic, distributed applications using the high-level, event driven Koord programming language included with CyPhyHouse, without requiring expertise in controller design or distributed network protocols.
